AgriSmart - Crop Price Predictor
Technologies & Tools Used
=========================

1. Machine Learning
-------------------
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest Regressor
  - Used for predicting future prices based on historical and weather (rainfall, temperature) data.
  - Models are trained per crop type.
- **Libraries:**
  - scikit-learn: Main ML library for models and data processing
  - joblib: Saving & loading trained models
- **Custom Preprocessing:**
  - Uses additional features: Month, Year, Average Rainfall (mm), Average Temperature (°C)
  - Data from CSVs for each state/crop

2. Backend (Python)
-------------------
- **Framework:** Flask 3.0
  - Fast and lightweight web server for all web/API endpoints
- **Session & Auth:**
  - Flask sessions, Werkzeug security, custom decorators for role protection
- **Database:**
  - SQLite, managed using Python scripts and Flask routes
  - User accounts (admin, farmer), prediction history, state crop info
- **Data Visualization:**
  - plotly, matplotlib, seaborn for generating charts and trend analysis

3. Frontend
-----------
- HTML5, CSS3 (Bootstrap 5 for layout/responsiveness)
- JavaScript (vanilla, for form checks & interactivity)
- FontAwesome for icons

4. Python Features
------------------
- Class-based config for states & crops
- Decorators for login/admin-required logic
- JSON API endpoint for live commodity lists
- Error handlers (404, 500) for better UX
- Scriptable database and retraining tools
- Modular utility scripts for crop recommendation, state config, and weather auto-fill

5. Project Structure Notes
--------------------------
- Separated folders for models, data, templates, static files
- Ready for deployment (Procfile for cloud, requirements.txt, runtime.txt)
